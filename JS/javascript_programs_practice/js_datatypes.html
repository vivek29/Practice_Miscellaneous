<!-- 
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100, and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put quotes around a number, it will be treated as a text string
